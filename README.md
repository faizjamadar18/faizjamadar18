#### 🔷 building from zero

I build from zero. Whether it's frontend, backend, full-stack applications, or AI-powered experiences, I work across the entire development lifecycle. From UI/UX to deployment to user feedback, I care less about technology debates and more about delivering results that people love using.




#### 🔷 currently exploring
- **AI/ML systems:** Integrating large language models into production applications, understanding model capabilities, and building intelligent user experiences.
- **Full-stack architecture:** Designing scalable, maintainable systems that span from user interfaces to backend infrastructure.
- **Developer experience:** Creating tools and extensions that enhance productivity and streamline development workflows.
